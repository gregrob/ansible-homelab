# Included tasks to handle individual GitHub repository cloning with SSH key generation.
# This file is called in a loop for each repository defined in the github_clone role.
#
# Steps performed:
#  1. Set repository-specific variables from the current loop item
#  2. Include github_keygen role to generate SSH keys for the repository
#  3. Display confirmation message with public key for manual GitHub setup
#  4. Pause execution for user to confirm SSH key has been added to GitHub
#  5. Ensure repository destination directory exists with correct permissions
#  6. Clone the GitHub repository using the generated SSH key
